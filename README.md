# Installing as BlocklyBias App
First clone this repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Claudio-95/BlocklyBias
```
Then you must have installed Python 3.9.x, because for now the app has been tested only on this version.

## Windows

You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3104/).

After installing it, open the terminal (cmd.exe) without launching it as admin, then change directory using:

```shell
cd .\root\to\your\repo
```
so, for example, if you have copied the repo in Documents\GitHub you must use:

```shell
cd .\Documents\GitHub\BlocklyBias
```
after this, you must activate the virtual environment using:

```shell
blocklybias_venv\Scripts\Activate
```

<!-- After cloning the repo you can either follow the Flask Method

### Flask Method

Install the requirements from `requirements.txt` with the following command

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt 
``` -->

In the end you can run the application by using:

```shell
python app.py
```
The browser address will be displayed on the main terminal window, you can click on it holding CTRL.

## Linux

If you are on Ubuntu you can install Python by using:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3.9.13
```
or Python 3.9 for Debian:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3.9
```

Not sure how to install Python on Fedora and other distributions.

After installing it, open the terminal without admin permissions, then change directory:

```shell
cd ./root/to/your/repo
```
after this, you must activate the virtual environment using:

```shell
source blocklybias_venv_linux\bin\activate
```

In the end you can run the application by using:

```shell
python app.py
```

or

```shell
python3 app.py
```

The browser address will be displayed on the main terminal window.
